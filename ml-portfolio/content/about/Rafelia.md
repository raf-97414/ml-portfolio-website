👋 Hi there! I’m **Rafelia**, a tech enthusiast who’s taken the leap from **hunting bugs** to exploring the incredible worlds of **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Generative AI (GenAI)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**. Here’s a glimpse into my journey:

---

### **🐞 From Bugs to Bots**
For the past **5 years**, I’ve worked as a **Freelance Security Researcher** (a.k.a. Bug Bounty Hunter 🕵️‍♀️) with platforms like **YesWeHack**, **HackerOne**, and **BugCrowd**. My mission? **Find and fix the sneakiest security flaws** to make the internet a safer place. 🐛🔒

But repetitive tasks? Not my thing. 🚫 That’s where **Python** became my trusty sidekick 🐍✨, helping me automate mundane work so I could focus on uncovering **complex and unexpected bugs**—because that’s where the fun is!

### **🤖 Diving Deep into AI, ML, GenAI & DL**
After years in cybersecurity, I discovered my true passion for **AI**. Why? Because it has the power to **transform lives** and **revolutionize industries**. Here’s what I’m delving into:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Building smarter systems that learn and adapt. 🧠📈
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Crafting tools that make life easier and more efficient. 🤖🌟
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Exploring creative AI that designs, writes, and innovates. 🎨📜
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Diving into neural networks to solve complex problems. 🕸️💡

#### **Courses Completed**:
🎓 I’ve enhanced my expertise by completing:
1. **Machine Learning, GenAI, and DL** courses at **ISRO**.
2. **IIT Kanpur’s Online Program**, where I learned advanced AI techniques and real-world applications.

### **📜 Demystifying AI (With a Side of LOLs)**
AI might seem overwhelming, but I’m on a mission to:
1. **Simplify AI concepts** and break down even the toughest research papers into bite-sized nuggets. 🍪📄
2. Use **humor** to highlight AI’s quirks—because let’s be honest, some AI fails are pure comedy gold. 🤣🤖
3. Bust myths about AI to make it **approachable for everyone**.

### **🎥 Content Creator Mode: Activated**
When I’m not diving into ML, AI, GenAI, or DL, I’m creating **engaging videos** for my YouTube channels. Check them out here:
- **AI Paws and Claws**: [@AIPawsAndClaws1/shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@AIPawsAndClaws1/shorts) 🐾✨
- **Prayer and Worship**: [@PrayerandWorship1](https://www.youtube.com/@PrayerandWorship1) 🙏🎶

My workflow involves leveraging **AI tools** for video creation and storytelling and using **Adobe Premiere Pro** to give my videos a professional touch. 🎬✨

Got a cool video idea? Let’s collaborate! 💌
