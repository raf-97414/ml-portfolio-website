# 🚀 Spore.Bio Raises $23M to Speed Up Microbiology Testing with AI  

**Food recalls = PR nightmares.** Contaminated products can cost companies **millions in fines**, tank their reputation, and turn their best-selling yogurt into a **biohazard meme**.  

Enter **Spore.Bio**, a **Paris-based deeptech startup** that just raised **$23M in Series A funding** to **reinvent microbiology testing**—using AI, of course. 🤖🔬

## 💰 Who’s Investing?  

This round was led by **Singular**, with backing from **Point 72 Ventures, 1st Kind Ventures (yes, the Peugeot family office), Station F, and even Lord David Prior**. 🏛️ Existing investors like **LocalGlobe, No Label Ventures, and Famille C** also doubled down on their bets.  

Why? **Because Spore.Bio is already making money**—they’ve signed commercial contracts covering **200 factories** and even **had to open a waitlist** to keep up with demand. **(Good problems to have.)**

## ⏳ Why Is Food Safety Still Stuck in the Dark Ages?  

Traditional microbiology testing is **sloooow**. 😴  

- **Food & beverage:** **5 days** to get results.  
- **Pharma & cosmetics:** **14 days** (because bacteria love a long vacation).  
- **Factories:** Can’t test on-site—samples must be sent to specialized labs.  

Basically, in a world where **robots make coffee and AI writes poetry**, companies still have to **wait for bacteria to grow** in a petri dish. **Not ideal.**

## ⚡ The AI-Powered Fix  

Instead of waiting days for cultures to grow, **Spore.Bio blasts samples with light** at specific wavelengths and records their **spectral signature**. Then, a **pre-trained deep learning model** instantly detects **bacteria and pathogens**.  

**🚀 Result:** Testing **happens on-site** and takes **minutes, not days**.  

Spore.Bio’s AI model is trained with **data from the Pasteur Institute** (fancy!), and they’re working on **manufacturing testing machines** so factories can **test on the spot** without shipping samples anywhere.

## 🌍 Beyond Food Safety  

CEO **Amine Raji** (a former Nestlé engineer) originally focused on **food & beverage safety**. But guess what? Other industries want in:  

- **💄 Cosmetics:** Preservatives are being phased out, but **less preservatives = more bacteria**.  
- **💊 Pharma:** **Gene & cell therapies** have a **7-day shelf life**, so **waiting 14 days for tests makes zero sense**.  

Basically, if your industry **hates bacteria**, Spore.Bio **has a solution for you**.

## 📈 What’s Next?  

- **Hiring spree:** Team is growing from **30 to 50 employees by the end of 2025**.  
- **Scaling up:** More factories, more machines, and **less waiting for bacteria to do their thing**.  

With **$23M in fresh funding**, Spore.Bio is on a mission to make microbiology testing **as fast as checking your phone**.  

**Because in 2025, waiting days for bacteria results is so last century.** 🦠⏳❌
