## **The Great AI Race or the Great AI Ruse?** 🏃‍♂️💨

Indian IT companies are on a mission to upskill 85% of their workforce in generative AI (GenAI) by FY25. 🧑‍💻✨ But here’s the kicker: the quality of this training might not be as “cutting-edge” as advertised.

### **Big Names, Small Efforts** 🎩➡️🪄  

A former Infosys employee revealed that despite partnerships with NVIDIA, Google, and Microsoft, much of the training is outsourced to smaller firms offering **entry-level courses on a budget**. The result? Employees end up clicking through **slideshows** 🤷‍♂️, answering **Googleable multiple-choice questions** 🔍, and voilà—they’re “GenAI Trained”! 🎓✨

This cost-effective approach helps IT firms polish their image as top-tier service providers 🌟 while their employees master... the art of clicking **‘Next’**. 🖱️➡️➡️➡️

## **Certifiably... Certified?** 🧾✔️  

Even social media couldn’t keep quiet about this trend:  

> “My friend completed a GenAI course in **an hour** by clicking ‘Next’ 100s of times. She’s now ‘GenAI Ready’! So proud. 😂”

Astonishingly, **900,000 employees** have undergone this training, but as insiders point out, these certifications are about as useful as a chatbot in a Shakespearean drama. 🤖📜

## **The Real Tasks: Chatbots & Copilots** 🤔💬  

Most Indian IT employees work on client-facing tools like chatbots or GitHub Copilot. **Deep generative AI knowledge? Not required!**  
“Experimenting with tools like Cursor or Copilot could help,” said the ex-employee, “but companies are hesitant because of **proprietary code paranoia**.” 🔒

## **Training... or Trend Chasing?** 📈🤡  

Indian IT seems caught in an endless loop of chasing the latest tech buzzword. From Python to the metaverse 🌌, now it’s GenAI, and tomorrow... who knows?  

A Reddit user quipped:  

> “Just like the metaverse c**p last year, now it’s GenAI. We have to pretend we know it to impress clients!”

## **What Needs to Change?** 🤷‍♀️🔧  

Industry experts suggest **real** training with:  

- **Interactive modules** 🎮  
- **Case studies** 📚  
- **Hackathons** 🏆  
- **Hands-on projects** 🛠️  

But right now, many programs focus on **compliance** over competence. **Click-through courses**? That’s just ticking boxes. ✅🗳️

## **Future Outlook: From Clicking to Creating** 🚀  

On a brighter note, some companies are starting to invest in **practical learning** by letting employees work on live AI projects. Satya Nadella, during his Bengaluru visit, promised Microsoft’s commitment to **upskilling 10 million people** in AI by 2030. 🏢🧑‍🎓  

So, while Indian IT firms rush to call their workforce “GenAI Ready,” perhaps the real goal should be: **“GenAI Competent.”** 🧠✨
