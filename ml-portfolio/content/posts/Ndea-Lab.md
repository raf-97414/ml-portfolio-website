François Chollet (a.k.a. the AI wizard behind **Keras**) 🧙‍♂️ has teamed up with Zapier's Mike Knoop 🛠️ to launch **Ndea**, a shiny new AGI lab aiming to crack the ultimate AI code! 🧩  

## What's the deal? 🤔  

- **Deep Learning + Program Synthesis = 🤖🧠**  
   They’re ditching the "big data, bigger GPUs" vibe for something more efficient—AI that learns like *humans* (a little faster, we hope).  

- **Think Big**  
   From curing diseases 🧬💊 to solving mysteries nobody's thought of yet, Ndea is basically building a **science factory** 🏭 for breakthroughs.  

- **Bye-Bye Big Data Limits**  
   Current AI is hungry for data 🍔📚. Ndea? They’re cooking up an AI that can learn *smarter*, not *harder*.  

## Bonus Points 🏆  

Chollet also started the **ARC Prize Foundation** 🏅, which makes benchmarks to test if AI is *actually* as smart as humans.  

## Why it’s Spicy 🌶️  

Chollet is a *big deal* in AI, and now he's bringing fresh ideas to the AGI party 🎉.  
With Ndea, Ilya Sutskever’s **SSI**, and other AI geniuses in the mix 🧠👩‍💻👨‍💻, the race to AGI could have some wild surprises ahead! 🚀✨
