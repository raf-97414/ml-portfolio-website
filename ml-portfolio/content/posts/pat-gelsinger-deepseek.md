## 🚨 Pat Gelsinger Chooses DeepSeek Over OpenAI at His New Startup, Gloo  

What do you do after leaving Intel and trying (but failing) to outdo Nvidia with your own AI chips? 🤔  
If you’re **Pat Gelsinger**, you jump ship to **DeepSeek** and stir the AI pot! 🍵  

Gelsinger, now chairman of **Gloo**, a messaging platform for churches ⛪, is all-in on **DeepSeek’s R1 model**—a high-performance, low-cost open-source AI reasoning model that’s making waves 🌊 (and tanking Nvidia’s stock 📉).

## 💰 **DeepSeek’s $5.5M AI Revolution vs. Billion-Dollar Behemoths**  

DeepSeek trained its **R1 model** in **two months** using 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, costing a mere **$5.5 million**. Compare that to U.S. giants throwing billions at AI chips 🤑, and you can see why R1 is *the talk of the town.*  

Gelsinger couldn’t hide his excitement:  
> **“Thank you DeepSeek team!”**

## 🤷 Why Skip OpenAI?  

Gloo, which is building an AI service called **Kallm** (yes, like “call me” 📞), decided to **ditch OpenAI’s APIs** in favor of R1.  

Gelsinger’s reasons?  
1. **Lower cost = More AI everywhere** 💸  
   - “I want better AI in my phone, my Oura Ring, my hearing aid, and even my EV!” 🚗💡  
2. **Open wins** 👐  
   - Unlike OpenAI and Anthropic, DeepSeek’s open-source approach reminds us of the **power of ingenuity.**  
3. **No dependency on closed ecosystems** 🔒  
   - Why rent an API when you can build your own AI service from scratch? 🤷  

In just **two weeks**, Gloo plans to have Kallm rebuilt using DeepSeek’s model. 🚀

## 🤔 Skepticism? Gelsinger Doesn’t Care  

Of course, DeepSeek’s meteoric rise hasn’t been without controversy:  
- **"Fake numbers!"** Some skeptics argue DeepSeek’s training costs must’ve been higher. 🕵️  
- **"Wait for OpenAI’s o3!"** Others think OpenAI’s next model will obliterate R1. 💥  
- **"China concerns!"** Privacy, censorship, and geopolitics loom large. 🌏  

Gelsinger? He’s unbothered. **“DeepSeek is 10-50x cheaper than o1,”** he says.  

> “Having the Chinese remind us of the power of open ecosystems is maybe a touch embarrassing for the Western world,” he adds. 😬

## 💡 Why This Matters  

DeepSeek’s R1 isn’t just a **win for affordability**—it’s a wake-up call for the AI industry. 🚨  

Instead of throwing more hardware at problems, **creativity and engineering** are pushing the boundaries of AI. 🛠️  

Meanwhile, Gelsinger is proof that even as AI heats up, **open-source innovation** might be the key to democratizing AI everywhere.

## 🤩 Final Thoughts  

With **DeepSeek’s R1**, the AI landscape is shifting—Nvidia, OpenAI, and Anthropic better watch their backs.  
As for Pat Gelsinger, he’s already ahead of the curve, rebuilding Kallm from scratch with **open AI power**. 💪  

Who’s next to join the DeepSeek revolution? 👀
