## 🧠 Yann LeCun: "LLMs? Nobody Will Use Them in 5 Years!"  

At the **World Economic Forum** in Davos, Meta’s chief AI scientist **Yann LeCun** dropped a bombshell 💣—he thinks **Generative AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) are doomed!**  

**Why?** Because they **“aren’t capable of much.”** Ouch. 😬  

According to LeCun, in the next 3 to 5 years, **"nobody in their right mind would use them anymore."** 🔥

## 🚨 So, What's the Problem with LLMs?  

LeCun laid out **four big reasons** why our beloved AI chatbots (👀 ChatGPT, Bard, Claude) aren't as smart as we think:  

1. **No awareness of the physical world 🌍** – They don’t know how to interact with objects or reality (so no, ChatGPT can’t help you move furniture). 🛋️  
2. **Memory loss 🧠❌** – They forget things faster than your grandpa does. No continuous memory means no long-term learning.  
3. **Lack of reasoning 🤷‍♂️** – They manipulate language well but struggle with actual *thinking.*  
4. **Can't plan complex tasks 📅❌** – Forget about AI making life decisions; it can't even plan your weekend efficiently.

## 🔮 The Future: What’s Next for AI?  

LeCun believes we’re heading into **a whole new AI era**, and within 3-5 years, AI will:  

- 🧠 **Develop common sense** (Finally, an AI that doesn't suggest pizza toppings for a birthday cake 🎂🍕).  
- 👀 **Learn from the world** by observing and interacting with it—like a curious toddler, but smarter.  
- 🤖 **Welcome the "Decade of Robotics"**, where AI meets robots for real-world applications.  

Meta is apparently working on **"mental models of the world"**, meaning future AI might actually *understand* things rather than just regurgitate Wikipedia. 📖💡

## 🤖 But Wait... OpenAI and Perplexity Disagree!  

While LeCun was busy predicting the doom of LLMs, OpenAI and Perplexity were like: **"Hold my beer." 🍺**  

**On Friday, they unveiled their new agentic AI models,** which claim to excel at complex multi-step tasks:  

- 🛒 **Operator (OpenAI):** Orders your groceries if you give it a list.  
- ✈️ **Flight booking:** Just drop your itinerary, and AI handles it.  
- 🤣 **Meme-making:** AI = your personal meme factory.  

Looks like LLMs aren’t going down without a fight! 🥊

## 🎯 Is This Just AI Hype?  

LeCun says the **"AI revolution"** might still be **10 years away**, but with how fast AI is evolving, it could be much closer. 🚀  

Meanwhile, Sam Altman and the OpenAI team are busy building AI agents that can book you dinner reservations and even manage your shopping. 🍽️🛍️  

So... who’s right? 🤔  

---

## 🏁 Final Thoughts  

While LeCun is convinced that **GenAI will soon be outdated**, companies like OpenAI are **doubling down on LLMs** and their capabilities.  

For now, AI is still learning—just like us—making mistakes, failing, and sometimes **ordering pineapple pizza** 🍍🍕 when you didn't ask for it.  

👀 **Stay tuned for more AI drama and breakthroughs.**
