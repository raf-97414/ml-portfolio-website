💬 **Sam Altman**: "Let’s charge $200/month for ChatGPT Pro! Easy money!" 🤑  
👨‍💻 **Users**: "Oh, really? Watch this." (Proceeds to use it like an all-you-can-eat AI buffet.) 🍔🤖  

Turns out, **running ChatGPT costs more than a yacht habit**. At one point, it was **$700K/day** to keep the AI thinking. 💸  

OpenAI has now entered *panic mode*:  
- **Step 1:** Admit they need "way more money than imagined." 😬  
- **Step 2:** "Should we raise prices?" 💰💭  

Despite burning cash like a flamethrower 🔥, they’re dreaming big: **$100 billion revenue by 2029**. (Yes, the same sales as Nestlé. AI KitKats, anyone?) 🍫🤖  

Meanwhile, OpenAI is still figuring out pricing, investments, and how to stop Pro users from treating it like a productivity cheat code. 🧑‍💻🚀  

For now, Sam’s pricing skills = 🤷‍♂️.
