# 🚀 Karman+ Raises $20M to Mine Asteroids (Yes, Really)  

Space mining. It sounds like **sci-fi nonsense** or the plot of a **questionable Netflix original**, but **Karman+ just raised $20M** to make it a reality. Their plan? **Send autonomous spacecraft to asteroids, mine materials, extract water, and refuel satellites in orbit.** 🤖⛏️🪐  

Because why launch stuff from Earth when you can **steal resources from space rocks** instead?

## 💰 Who’s Funding This Space Heist?  

Leading this **YOLO-in-space** mission:  

- **Plural (London) & Hummingbird (Antwerp)** 🏦  
- **HCVC (Paris) & angel investors** 👼  
- **Lookout’s Kevin Mahaffey & Karman+ CEO Teun van den Dries himself** 💸  

The team thinks they can **slash costs** of asteroid missions from **$1B to just $10M** per trip. Investors were like, *“Sounds crazy, but let’s do it.”* 🚀💰  

---

## 🪐 How It Works (In Theory)  

1. **Launch a spacecraft** 🛰️ → 🚀 **Fly millions of miles to an asteroid**  
2. **Mine regolith (asteroid dirt)** ⛏️ → 💦 **Extract water from it**  
3. **Use water as rocket fuel** ⛽ → 🔥 **Refuel satellites & space tugs**  
4. **Profit.** 💰 (Hopefully.)  

The big idea? If they can **harvest materials in space**, **space travel becomes cheaper**—no need to launch **tons of fuel and supplies from Earth**.  

Sounds great. *Super easy. Barely an inconvenience.* Except…

## 🤔 The (Many) Challenges  

🚧 **Problem 1:** Their spacecraft doesn’t exist yet. (**Minor detail.**)  
🚧 **Problem 2:** Asteroids are **moving targets**, orbiting the sun.  
🚧 **Problem 3:** Not all satellites **even use water-based fuel** (oops).  
🚧 **Problem 4:** NASA spent **$1B per asteroid mission** before. Karman+ says **they can do it for $10M**. We’ll see.  

Oh, and they’ll **need to raise more money** before launch. Because, obviously.

## 👨‍🚀 Why Do This Instead of, You Know, SaaS?  

Karman+ CEO **Teun van den Dries** built and sold a **real estate SaaS startup for $290M**. Instead of **coasting on that**, he decided:  

*"I could optimize another SaaS company… or I could mine asteroids."*  

Because **space is cooler than spreadsheets.**  

Co-founder **Daynan Crull** (a data scientist turned **"mission architect"**) joined him. They picked asteroid mining because:  

🚀 **Fusion was too mainstream** (and already raised $5B).  
🪐 **Asteroids are easier to reach than the Moon** (apparently).  
💰 **Mining space rocks could be cheaper than launching resources from Earth.**  

---

## 🗓️ What’s Next?  

- **Build an actual spacecraft** 🏗️ (kinda important).  
- **Test mining tech before their first mission in 2027** ⏳.  
- **Raise more funding.** Because **space is expensive**.  

Karman+ is taking things **one step at a time**, but their investors love their **skeptical, realistic approach** (*unlike some of those "move fast and break things" software startups*).  

Will it work? TBD. But one thing’s for sure: **asteroid mining is now officially a startup category.**  

**🚀 Space is getting weird. And we’re here for it.** 🛸💎
