# 💰 Perplexity Launches $50M VC Fund – Because AI Money Never Sleeps 🤖💸  

If **raising $500 million** at a **$9 billion valuation** wasn’t enough, Perplexity is now **giving away** some of that cash! 🤑  

They’re launching a **$50M venture fund** to invest in **seed and pre-seed startups**—because **AI search engines aren’t just for searching, they’re also for funding.** 🔍💸

## 🧐 What’s Happening?  

✅ **Perplexity raised** $500M in December 📈  
✅ Now launching a **$50M seed & pre-seed VC fund** 🚀

📊 **Good for business** – Invest in the next big thing before someone else does.  
🚀 **Smart move** – Perplexity is **betting on the AI future** while still growing itself.

|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 💰 Uses own money? | Yes ✅ | No ❌ |
| 🚀 Focus | AI & startups | AI startups |
| 🏆 Fund Managers | Kelly & Joanna | OpenAI execs |
| 🔮 Goal | Fund the future, get early access to cool tech | Same, but without spending their own cash |
