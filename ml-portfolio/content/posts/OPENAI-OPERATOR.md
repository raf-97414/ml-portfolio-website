2. **Google DeepMind's Mariner** 🌊  

Here’s how Operator performs on key tests:

| OSWorld (merging PDFs, etc.)  | 38.1%         | 22.0%                    | N/A           |

## 🛠️ How Does Operator Work?  

Instead of relying on **APIs**, Operator:  

1. **Scans your screen like a human.** 🕵️  
2. **Clicks buttons, types text, and navigates menus.** 🖱️⌨️  
3. **Repeats until the task is done.** 🔄  

💡 **Translation:** It works just like YOU do online, only faster (and without the "Oops, forgot my password" moments).  

---

## 🚦 Is It Safe?  

Yes! OpenAI’s **red team** has been working hard to ensure Operator doesn't go rogue.  

🔒 **Safety features include:**  
- Stops to ask users before making critical decisions. ⚠️  
- Can handle sneaky websites with hidden instructions. 🕵️‍♂️  
- Won’t help you research... uh... "questionable" stuff. 🚫💣  

**Casey Chu**, a researcher at OpenAI, assures us that Operator is trained to be cautious, asking for clarification when needed. 👍

## 🔧 Operator in Action  

Here’s how Operator can make your life easier:  

1. **Date night planning:** 📅

   - It checks availability, gives options, and you're all set—no effort required!  
   
2. **Grocery shopping:** 🛒  
   - Snap a pic of your shopping list, and Operator adds it to Instacart.

**"I just type and watch it go,"** says OpenAI's researcher, Yash Kumar. "My hands are off the keyboard!" 👏
