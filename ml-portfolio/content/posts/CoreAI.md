🚨 **Big Tech Alert**: Microsoft is at it again, stirring the AI pot and adding more layers to its tech empire. This time, they’ve unveiled a new **engineering org** so dev-focused it practically smells like coffee and commit messages. Meet **CoreAI — Platform and Tools**! ☕💻

### What's Cooking at Microsoft? 🍳
Microsoft decided that combining existing teams into one *super team* was the next logical step. CoreAI is like an AI smoothie made by blending:  
- **Dev Div** 🍇 (developers, developers, developers!)  
- **AI Platform Teams** 🍌 (all about those tasty ML tools).  
- A sprinkle of talent from the **Office of the CTO** 🍓 (because why not?).  

And leading this new concoction? **Jay Parikh** — the ex-Meta VP, *data center guy*, and former CEO of cloud security startup Lacework. Talk about a résumé glow-up. 💼✨

### A Peek Inside CoreAI 🔍
Satya Nadella himself wrote in a memo (likely while sipping on his morning chai):  
> "Our focus this year is *model-forward* applications that will reshape all application categories."  

Translation: Microsoft’s dev teams are laser-focused on making AI-powered apps that’ll make you say, *“Wait, is this Excel or Skynet?”* 📈🤖

### Jay Parikh: The New MVP 🏆
Parikh isn’t new to tech drama.  
- At **Meta**, he worked on technical infrastructure and data centers — a.k.a. the backbone of the internet.  
- At **Lacework**, he got a crash course in **cloud security** 🛡️.  
- Now, at **Microsoft**, he’s reporting directly to Nadella (no pressure, Jay 😅).

The man clearly loves juggling *big* responsibilities. Rumor has it his calendar invites are already AI-generated. 📅🤔

### TL;DR 🎉
- Microsoft mashed its dev and AI teams into **CoreAI** to focus on *model-forward* innovation.  
- Jay Parikh, fresh from Meta and Lacework, is at the helm.  
- AI is now Microsoft’s top-tier obsession. And frankly, we’re here for it. 🤖✨  

Stay tuned, folks. CoreAI might just build the apps that *replace us all*. 😜
