🚨 **AI Drama Alert!** 🚨

Former OpenAI head of special projects *just left* to join a new AI lab founded by none other than ex-OpenAI boss **Mira Murati**—the queen of *AGI dreams* 🤖✨. According to whispers, Murati has already **snatched** 🕵️‍♀️ about **10 top-tier researchers and engineers** from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Character AI. Her new company? Still **nameless** and **directionless** 🚶‍♀️🤷‍♀️, but everyone’s hyped anyway.

## The Backstory

Murati left OpenAI shortly after CEO **Sam Altman** got *temporarily fired* in late 2023—a boardroom drama worthy of Netflix 🍿. During the chaos, Murati became **interim CEO** for a hot second, and Altman was like, *"Ouch, that hurts"* 😬. He even called it the *“low point”* of the mess. 

But surprise! 💥 After **730 OpenAI employees** threatened to walk out ✊, Altman made a **comeback** like a true AI boss 🏆.

## Murati’s Big Move

After the dust settled, Murati stayed at OpenAI for 10 more months, working alongside Altman. When she left, her goodbye note was all like:

> *“No hard feelings, just chasing my dreams ✌️”*

Fast forward a month, and rumor has it she’s raising **$100 million** 🤑 for her **secretive startup**.

## OpenAI’s Brain Drain 🧠🚪

The exodus of OpenAI talent is *wild*:
- **Barret Zoph** (VP of research) and **Bob McGrew** (chief research officer) peaced out.
- OG cofounder **Ilya Sutskever** said, *“Later, nerds!”*, and started **Safe Superintelligence**, which casually raised **$1 billion** 🏦.
- Even **Anthropic**, another major rival, is basically an OpenAI reunion with billions of dollars in funding 💸.

Looks like the AI world is one big messy group chat—full of *breakups*, *makeups*, and *startup glow-ups* 💔💼🚀.
